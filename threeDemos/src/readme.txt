This project was made by codesandbox as:
  javascript-devbox. 
For this template, the dist folder seems to serve whatever is in it similar to /public folder in react.
So circle.svg is in /dist
U need to add three.js; in codesandbox do dependencies on left file manager and search for 
"three", not "three.js" and add it. Codesandbox workings are ?????
