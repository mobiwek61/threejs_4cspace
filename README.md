### Visual studio problem:
- it only edits one file at a time without multiple tabs at top for each file. Opening a new file disappears the last editor window.    
  To change: file->settings->[search for "preview"]->"workbench-editor-enable_preview"->and unclick.  Now a new tab opens each time a file is edited. 
- How to show web app in a tab:  
  Start app with "npm run dev".  Then you can choose it from a popup or if you don't, later on click "ports" at bottom and click icon when you mouseover says "preview in editor"    
  If you don't see "ports" do menu->view->terminal
